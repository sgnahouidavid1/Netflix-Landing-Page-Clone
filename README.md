# Netflix-Landing-Page-Clone
The project will be a clone website of the Netflix Landing Page. This project is for learn more about CSS and Html and a little bit of Javascript. I created this website on my own with very limited help from online tutorials like [Build a Netflix Landing Page Clone with HTML, CSS & JS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7t13SGytRk).

The purpose of this project was to test my skills and understanding in building a responsive webnsite with HTML and CSS and a little Javascript to create the FAQ Accordion and Footor Links Accordion.

## A list of concepts I learn were:
  - Flexbox posiiton
  - CSS Grid position
  - Media Queries (responsiveness)
  - Background Shadowing
  - Javascript accordion
  - Css transformations, X/Y Translations, Rotating, and Transition
